/**
 * WHO IS SIGNED IN, AND WHAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE
 * =====================================================
 * The four roles from the problem statement, defined ONCE — exactly the way
 * every status word in the app is defined once in src/lib/statuses.js.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SAY THIS TO A JUDGE, BECAUSE IT IS THE HONEST DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *   This is a DEMO ROLE SELECTOR, not authentication. There is no password
 *   to check, no user table, no token and nothing is verified. Anyone who
 *   opens the app can pick any role.
 *
 *   That is deliberate. A password box that accepts anything you type is
 *   WORSE than no password box at all, because it looks like security that
 *   is not there. We would rather show the part that is real.
 *
 *   The part that IS real is the part that matters to the design: the
 *   console knows who is using it, and it shows different controls to
 *   different people. Sign in as the Field Scientist and the buttons that
 *   create and edit records are gone — not decoration, actually not
 *   rendered. The dropdowns that also DISPLAY a value stay on screen but
 *   are disabled, because a read-only session still has to be able to read.
 *
 *   A real deployment would put NCPOR's own sign-in (or Supabase Auth) in
 *   front of this screen, and would enforce these same rules ON THE SERVER
 *   as well. Hiding a button in a browser prevents a mistake; it does not
 *   stop an attacker. Both halves are needed, and we have built the half
 *   that a prototype can honestly build.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * EACH ROLE HAS:
 *   label       what the sidebar and the badge show
 *   tone        which badge colour it uses (see TONE_COLOUR in statuses.js)
 *   icon        a Lucide icon component, same idea as src/lib/navigation.js
 *   remit       one line explaining the job, shown on the sign-in screen
 *   operator    a FICTIONAL default name, pre-filled into the sign-in box
 *   canManage   may edit expeditions, the roster, cargo and stock records
 *   canRespond  may acknowledge and resolve incidents
 *
 * WHY ONLY TWO PERMISSION FLAGS?
 *   Because two is all it takes to tell the four roles apart, and every
 *   flag here has a visible effect somewhere in the UI. A permission that
 *   nothing checks is dead code pretending to be a feature.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT A PERMISSION:
 *   EVERY role can REPORT an emergency — including the read-only one. The
 *   field scientist standing next to the casualty is exactly the person who
 *   raises the alarm, so blocking that would be unrealistic here and
 *   dangerous in a real system. "Read-only" in this app means *cannot
 *   change the logistics record*. It never means *cannot ask for help*.
