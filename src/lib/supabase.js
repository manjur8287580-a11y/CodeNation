/**
 * THE SUPABASE CLIENT — AND THE SWITCH THAT MAKES IT OPTIONAL
 * ==========================================================
 * This is the ONLY file that creates a database connection. Nothing else in
 * the project calls `createClient`.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ONE RULE THIS WHOLE PHASE IS BUILT AROUND:
 *
 *   THE APP MUST WORK WITH NO DATABASE AT ALL.
 *
 * With no keys set, `supabase` below is simply `null`, the app runs on the
 * built-in demo data exactly as it did before this file existed, and nothing
 * anywhere shows an error — because nothing is wrong. A database you have
 * not set up yet is not a failure, it is just an upgrade you have not taken.
 *
 * That is not a nicety. It is the difference between a demo that survives a
 * dead venue wifi and one that does not.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * WHERE THE KEYS COME FROM AND WHERE THEY GO:
 *   They go in a file called `.env` in the project root — the same folder as
 *   package.json. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in two lines.
 *   `.env.example` has click-by-click instructions for finding both values
 *   in the Supabase dashboard.
 *
 *   `.env` is listed in .gitignore, so it is never committed. Nothing in
 *   this project ever contains a real key in its source code.
 *
 * WHY "VITE_" IS AT THE START OF BOTH NAMES:
 *   Vite refuses to hand a variable to browser code unless its name starts
 *   with VITE_. That is a safety feature: it means you cannot leak a server
 *   secret into a web page by accident. The prefix is required.
 *
 * IS IT SAFE TO PUT THIS KEY IN A BROWSER? YES — THAT ONE.
 *   The "anon public" key is designed to be public; every Supabase web app
 *   ships it to the browser. What actually protects the data is Row Level
 *   Security, the policies at the bottom of supabase/schema.sql.
 *
 *   And here is the honest part: OUR prototype policies are wide open, so
 *   anyone with the URL can read and write the demo tables. That is a
 *   deliberate choice for a hackathon prototype with fictional data in it,
 *   and it is written down in schema.sql where the policies are created.
 *   A real deployment would replace them with per-user rules.
 *
 *   The "service_role" key is the opposite: a real secret that must never
 *   reach a browser. This app never reads it, and you should never put it
 *   in a VITE_ variable.
