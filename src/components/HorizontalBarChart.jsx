/**
 * HORIZONTAL BAR CHART
 * ====================
 * One small wrapper around Recharts that every chart in this app uses:
 * the inventory stock chart, cargo by status, cargo by priority, and the
 * two charts on the dashboard. Five charts, one component — so they all
 * look the same, and a fix here fixes all of them.
 *
 * WHY THE BARS RUN SIDEWAYS
 * Our labels are things like "Cold Weather Sleeping Bags" and
 * "Snowmobile Spare Tracks". Standing those under vertical columns means
 * rotating them or cutting them short. Sideways bars give every label a
 * full line of ordinary left-to-right text, which is easier to read and
 * far easier to fit on a phone.
 *
 * WHAT YOU PASS IN
 *   data   [{ label, value, colour, note, tip }]
 *            label  - the name printed down the left. MUST BE UNIQUE
 *                     within one chart: Recharts groups bars by this
 *                     value, so two rows called the same thing would be
 *                     drawn as one bar.
 *            value  - how long the bar is
 *            colour - a plain colour string like '#ff6a3d'
 *            note   - short text printed at the end of the bar (optional)
 *            tip    - the line shown on hover (optional, falls back to note)
 *
 * WHY colour IS A PLAIN STRING AND NOT A CSS CLASS
 * See the TONE_COLOUR block in src/lib/statuses.js. Short version: an SVG
 * fill cannot read a CSS variable, so charts are given the literal colour.
 * Always pass statusColour(SOME_MAP, key) so a bar matches its badge.
 *
 * NO ENTRY ANIMATION, ON PURPOSE
 * Recharts grows bars from zero when they first appear. We turn that off
 * (isAnimationActive={false}). These charts are wired to live data: press
 * minus on an inventory item and the bar must simply be shorter. An
 * animation on every keystroke reads as decoration, and master prompt
 * section 20 asks us to keep motion to a minimum.

 * legend promises those are the real quantities. A short bar is a small
 * loss; a cut-off number is a wrong number.
 *
 * The figures are monospaced, so every character is the same width and
