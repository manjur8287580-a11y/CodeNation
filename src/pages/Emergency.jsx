/**
 * EMERGENCY RESPONSE
 * ==================
 * The demo's centrepiece (master prompt sections 5, 12 and 19).
 *
 * WHAT A DUTY OFFICER DOES HERE, top to bottom:
 *   1. Sees how many incidents are open, and how many nobody has picked up.
 *   2. Works down the RESPONSE BOARD — worst first, longest-waiting first.
 *   3. Acknowledges an incident, assigns a team, resolves it.
 *   4. Reports a new one.
 *   5. Checks whether the people and the stores to respond actually exist.
 *
 * THE CONNECTIONS (master prompt section 12) — six of them, and every one
 * works because there is only ONE copy of the data in
 * src/store/DataContext.jsx. No page tells another page anything:
 *
 *   1. Report an incident -> the Dashboard's "Critical Alerts" number goes
 *      up on its own, because that number is COUNTED from the same array.
 *   2. Report it against a person -> that person flips to EMERGENCY, which
 *      changes their badge on Personnel and their marker on the Live Map.
 *   3. Every incident carries coordinates, so it appears on the Live Map as
 *      a pulsing red ring the moment it is filed.
 *   4. RESOLVE it -> the same person is released back to ACTIVE, and the
 *      marker goes from red to green. The connection runs both ways.
 *   5. The readiness panel reads the INVENTORY of the site the incident
 *      happened at. An open medical call at Maitri sits next to Maitri's
 *      medical kits — and those kits are below minimum.
 *   6. Every action writes a line into the Dashboard's Recent Activity.
 *
 * THE HONEST PART (master prompt section 21):
 *   THIS CONSOLE SENDS NOTHING. No SMS, no satellite message, no radio
 *   call, no pager. Assigning a team RECORDS a decision for the operator;
 *   telling that team happens on the radio, the way it really does. The
 *   page says so in plain words rather than implying a capability the
 *   prototype does not have. Coordinates are simulated demo positions,
 *   not a live GPS or beacon feed.
