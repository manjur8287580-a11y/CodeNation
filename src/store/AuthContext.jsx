/**
 * THE SIGN-IN STORE  ("AuthContext")
 * ==================================
 * Remembers who is signed in and what they may change. That is all it does.
 *
 * It is a second Context sitting beside DataContext, deliberately kept
 * separate: DataContext is about the EXPEDITION (people, cargo, stock,
 * incidents), this one is about the PERSON LOOKING AT IT. Mixing the two
 * would mean every re-render of a cargo row also depended on the login.
 *
 * IT IS NOT SECURITY, AND IT DOES NOT PRETEND TO BE.
 *   No password is checked, because there is no password. Nothing is sent
 *   anywhere. Nothing is verified. The full, honest explanation lives at the
 *   top of src/lib/roles.js — read that before demoing this feature, because
 *   a judge may well ask.
 *
 * WHAT PAGES DO WITH IT:
 *     const { canManage } = useAuth()
 *     {canManage && <button>New</button>}
 *
 *   That is the whole API a page needs. Same shape as useData().

 * failure to read simply means "nobody is signed in" and you see the sign-in
