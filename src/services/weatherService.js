/**
 * WEATHER SERVICE
 * ===============
 * THE ONLY FILE IN THE PROJECT THAT TALKS TO THE WEATHER API.
 *
 * Master prompt section 13 asks us to keep API logic out of the UI. So the
 * page (src/pages/Weather.jsx) does no fetching, no URL building and no
 * JSON digging — it calls fetchWeather() and lays out whatever comes back.
 * If Open-Meteo ever changes its response, this is the only file to edit.
 *
 * ABOUT THE API KEY: THERE ISN'T ONE.
 * Open-Meteo is free for non-commercial use and needs no account, no key
 * and no sign-up. There is nothing to put in .env for weather. (Supabase
 * in a later phase does need keys — that will be explained there.)
 * Docs: https://open-meteo.com/en/docs
 *
 * THE HONESTY RULE THAT SHAPES THIS WHOLE FILE
 * Every result carries a `source` of either LIVE or FALLBACK, and the page
 * is built to show that difference loudly. We never present an invented
 * number as a measurement. If the network is down, you get clearly-labelled
 * indicative figures and the real error text — not a blank screen, and not
 * a lie. fetchWeather() therefore NEVER THROWS: it always resolves to
 * something the page can render.
