/**
 * EMERGENCY SERVICE
 * =================
 * How incidents are stored. Same three parts as expeditionService.js.
 *
 * THE TWO TIMESTAMPS THAT ONLY EXIST IF THEY ARE WRITTEN DOWN:
 *   `acknowledged_at` and `resolved_at` are stamped the moment an incident is
 *   picked up and the moment it is closed. Neither can be reconstructed
 *   afterwards from anything else in the row — if they are not saved at the
 *   time, the answer to "how long before somebody responded" is gone for
 *   good. That is the number an emergency service is actually judged on, so
 *   these two columns are the ones in this whole schema most worth having in
 *   a database rather than in a browser tab.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:
 *   It does not send an SMS, page a satellite terminal or call anybody. It
 *   writes a row. The master prompt rules real emergency communications out
 *   of this prototype, and pretending otherwise would be the most dangerous
 *   thing this app could get wrong — a console that looks like it alerted a
 *   rescue team when it only wrote to a table. Reporting an incident here
 *   makes it visible to whoever is looking at the console. Nothing more.
